name: Invoke an Ansible docs build
description: Builds the docs. Requires initialized build environment.
inputs:
  build-script:
    description: The path to the build script.
    required: false
    default: ${{ runner.temp }}/docsbuild/build.sh

    description: The path where the build script will output the HTML.
    required: false

  copy-build:
    description: |
      If set, copy the built HTML files to this path after building, and set the build-html output to this path instead.
      This is useful if you need to do multiple builds from the same environment, or otherwise need the files to be elsewhere.
      Note: files in the destination that do not exist in the source will be deleted!
