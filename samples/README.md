# Samples

These are samples of workflows you can add to your repository to use the actions and workflows in this repository, to build Ansible docs for your collection.

They are mostly ready to go, but can be customized to your needs. See the [wiki pages](https://github.com/ansible-community/github-docs-build/wiki) to browse the full options for each workflow and action.

The shared workflows in this repository make use of the actions in this repository, and you can use those reusable workflows as-is, or use them as a basis for creating your own workflows that do things a bit differently.

Your repository's workflow can combine jobs that use reusable workflows, and traditional job definitions with your own steps, so there is a lot of flexibility to be had. The workflows and actions here are meant to be modular in that way.
